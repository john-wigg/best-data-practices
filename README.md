### Licence

Pick a license that's well suited for your project.

For open source projects, this site seems to be informative: https://choosealicense.com/

A very popular and very permissive license is the MIT License.

Creative Commons Licenses may also be a good choice since they allow you to control what rights you want to retain: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/
